Game Description:

A group of players (usually two) start with everyone's 1 left finger and
1 right finger.

Players play in turn. In each turn, a player could choose to add one of
the opponent's hand to one of his/her own. One hand could only express
number from 1 to 10.

Until a player could not make any moves, he/she would be lost.
